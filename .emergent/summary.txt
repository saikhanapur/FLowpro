<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed FlowForge AI from MVP, addressing critical bugs and implementing significant features. Initial efforts focused on fixing document upload issues (browser  vs. backend 200 OK) and LLM parsing errors (Pydantic validation for  and ). A major Move to Workspace feature was fully implemented and tested. Subsequently, the Add Context workflow (voice/chat) was integrated, including backend transcription and frontend UI. Authentication (email/password, Google OAuth) and a marketing landing page were then built. Key challenges included persistent Google OAuth login issues, which required a complete re-architecture of the frontend authentication state. The current task involves rebranding the application from FlowForge AI to SuperHumanly, updating the landing page and header to reflect this new brand and marketing message.

<product_requirements>
FlowForge AI (now SuperHumanly) aims to transform complex workflows into interactive flowcharts, offering process capture via voice, documents, or chat, AI-driven parsing (Claude API), and visual flowchart generation. It targets enterprise users with a Landing Page/Dashboard, Process Creation, Interactive Flowchart Canvas, and Output/Export. Key implemented features include: core process creation, AI parsing with an Apple-inspired UI, multi-process detection from documents, a Publish feature with shareability and versioning, and a foundational Workspaces feature for organizing processes. Recent additions include Move to Workspace functionality, the ability to add voice/chat context during process creation, enterprise authentication (email/password and Google OAuth), and a marketing landing page. The user desires a Superhumanly brand, emphasizing Easy Visualization, Interactive, Dynamic, Simplified for enterprise customers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of rebranding the application from FlowForge AI to the new SuperHumanly brand, as per the user's explicit request. This involved updating the marketing landing page () with the new brand name, new taglines (e.g., Superhuman process visualization, Process documentation at superhuman speed), and removing placeholders such as the demo video and Trusted by teams section. Several edits to  were successfully made to apply this new branding and content. The very next step in this rebranding effort is to update the application's  component to also reflect the SuperHumanly brand and potentially the new marketing taglines. This work is part of a broader effort to refine the product's market positioning after significant feature development.
