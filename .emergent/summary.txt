The previous AI engineer successfully brought the application from MVP to a more refined state. Initial work focused on critical bug fixes (document upload, LLM parsing, authentication), major feature implementations like Move to Workspace, Add Context, and a complete authentication system with Google OAuth. The core task at the end was rebranding from FlowForge AI to SuperHumanly, involving extensive UI updates. Subsequent work focused on fixing critical authentication issues stemming from cookie conflicts and incorrect token handling, leading to Loading processes... errors. Following this, the engineer addressed several workflow and display issues related to user data isolation, workspace creation, and dashboard empty states. Most recently, the engineer worked on implementing a robust sharing and publishing workflow with access controls, and progress indicators, which is partially complete. The current immediate task is to fix styling issues with the newly implemented Share Modal.

<product_requirements>
SuperHumanly (formerly FlowForge AI) aims to convert complex workflows into interactive flowcharts, supporting process capture via voice, documents, or chat, powered by AI (Claude API). It features an Apple-inspired UI, multi-process detection, a Publish feature with shareability, and a Workspaces feature for organization. Key functionalities added include Move to Workspace, voice/chat context integration during creation, and enterprise authentication (email/password, Google OAuth). The desired brand SuperHumanly emphasizes Easy Visualization, Interactive, Dynamic, Simplified for enterprise customers. Recent user feedback highlighted critical needs: robust sharing with version control, granular edit capabilities, accurate error handling, consistent branding, legal pages, and an intuitive user experience from login to process creation and viewing. The goal is to prepare the application for early user testing and potential public deployment, achieving enterprise-grade credibility.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in Phase 3 of the Critical Fixes Sprint, specifically working on the **Sharing & Publish Workflow**. This involved enhancing the share functionality to include access controls and ensuring read-only views for shared processes. A new  component was created and integrated into . The  was also updated to accept and respect a  prop, hiding action buttons when a process is viewed in read-only mode, and the  was cleaned up.

The last action performed was receiving user feedback about the 's styling being all over and overlapping with background content. The engineer has identified this as a styling issue within the  component.
